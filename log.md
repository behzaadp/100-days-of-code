# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 11, 2023
**Today's Progress**: Started with a minor project from the list of potential projects that I intend to complete. Refreshed the basics of git and github.

**Thoughts:** There was some struggle initially trying to remember how git worked but I was able to refresh it succesfully after watching 1 tutorial video. There are some decent ideas to approach my project, so hopefully it turns out to be good.
