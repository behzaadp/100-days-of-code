# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 11, 2023
**Today's Progress**: Started with a minor project from the list of potential projects that I intend to complete. Refreshed the basics of git and github.

**Thoughts:** There was some struggle initially trying to remember how git worked but I was able to refresh it succesfully after watching 1 tutorial video. There are some decent ideas to approach my project, so hopefully it turns out to be good.

### Day 1: February 12, 2023
**Today's Progress**: Created a game logic using a primitive flowchart, and now the movie name is printed with just underscores instead of the letters while preserving whitespace locations(both with or without vowels)

**Thoughts:** I honestly feel the progress is quite slow, but I am slowing getting the hang to divide each step into smaller steps or each problem into smaller problems so that I don't overwhelm myself. I think working on one step at a time, rather than rushing to complete it is a better way.
